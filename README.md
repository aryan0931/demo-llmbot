# LLM GitHub Repo Integration

## Overview

This project involves creating an application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with and analyze GitHub repositories. The application performs the following tasks:

1. **Download and Extract GitHub Repository**: Downloads a GitHub repository as a ZIP file, extracts its contents, and processes the files.
2. **Process Files and Summarize**: Reads the files from the repository, generates summaries using an LLM, and stores these summaries.
3. **Update Knowledge Base**: Monitors and processes changes in the GitHub repository, updating the knowledge base with new summaries.
4. **Create and Manage Vector Database**: Converts file summaries into vectors for efficient search and stores them in a vector database.
5. **LLM Agent for Search**: Uses a vector database to run a search query and retrieve relevant summaries.
6. **GitHub Issue Handling**: Automatically responds to open issues in the GitHub repository based on the content of the issues.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `PyGithub`: For interacting with the GitHub API.
- `transformers`: For using the LLM to generate summaries.
- `faiss-cpu` or `faiss-gpu`: For creating and managing the vector database.
- `numpy`: For handling numerical operations.

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install requests PyGithub transformers faiss-cpu numpy
```

## Getting Started

### Configuration

1. **Set Up Your GitHub Access Token**: You need a GitHub access token to interact with the GitHub API. You can generate one from your GitHub account settings.

2. **Update the Script**:
    - Replace `"your_github_access_token"` with your GitHub access token.
    - Replace `"https://github.com/user/repo"` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze.

### Usage

1. **Download and Extract Repository**: The script will download the specified GitHub repository as a ZIP file, extract it, and process the files.

2. **Process Files**: The files are read, and summaries are generated using an LLM. These summaries are stored and used for further analysis.

3. **Update Knowledge Base**: The script will update the knowledge base with summaries of new changes in the repository.

4. **Create Vector Database**: Summaries are converted into vectors, which are then stored in a vector database for efficient search.

5. **Run LLM Agent**: You can query the vector database using an example query vector to retrieve relevant summaries.

6. **Handle GitHub Issues**: The script automatically responds to open issues in the repository based on their content.

### Running the Script

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python script file.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to configure and use the script:

1. Update the `repo_url` and `access_token` in the script.
2. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

3. The script will process the repository, create summaries, manage the vector database, and handle GitHub issues.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for:

- Network requests
- File operations
- API interactions

Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and network access to avoid issues.

## Future Improvements

- **Integration with Rust**: For enhanced performance, integrate Rust code with the Python script.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling and logging for better troubleshooting.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize vector creation and search for large repositories.
